# Eddy-Current-Braking-System

#### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

The Thermal analysis of both eddy current braking system (ECB) and the disc braking system (DB) were performed. The results were compared. Further analysis based on the following faсtors was сarried out– 

1) Variation of brake torque with respeсt to air gap between eleсtromagnets

2) Variation of brake torque with respeсt to thiсkness of the disс.

The purpose of the project is to propose a much better and efficient braking system then mechanical braking by use of electromagnetic braking.

An enormous amount of energy is lost to overcome friction in usual mechanical braking system, eddy current braking system or electro-magnetic braking can prove to be a fulfilling solution for frictionless braking

#### **FILES DESCRIPTION**

3D Models of the eddy current braking system (ECB) and the disc braking system (DB) were created usng SolidWorks

Finite element models of both ECB and DB were simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics and ANSYS Workbench respectively.

#### **PAPER DESCRIPTION**

A Research paper was written and published in the ICAAA Conference 2018
